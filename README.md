# PassagerCounter


This JavaScript code defines two functions, `increment` and `decrease`, along with a variable `count` initialized to 0. The `countEl` variable is assigned the element with the id "count-el" from the HTML document using `document.getElementById("count-el")`.

The `increment` function checks if the `count` variable is less than 100. If it is, it increments `count` by 1 and updates the text content of the element with id "count-el" to reflect the new value of `count`.

The `decrease` function checks if the `count` variable is greater than 0. If it is, it decrements `count` by 1 and updates the text content of the element with id "count-el" to reflect the new value of `count`.

In summary, this code allows for incrementing and decrementing the value displayed in an HTML element with the id "count-el" within the range of 0 to 100.
